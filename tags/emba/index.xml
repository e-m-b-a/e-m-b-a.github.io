While we started investigating the device via the network, we also wanted to use our firmware scanner EMBA for the automated firmware analysis tasks. The firmware was available from the QNAP download site and starting EMBA with the default profile looks like a quick win. After a while we realised that EMBA was running into the deep-extraction mode and finally failed extracting the needed firmware.</description></item><item><title>Reporting improvements for EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:04:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</guid><description>We have included a template mechanism for creating better and more customised reports in EMBA. Now it is possible to place plain text template files or shell scripts to the EMBA directory ./report_templates. The naming of the files is quite strict. This means for the module P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract.sh a reporting template with the name P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.sh or P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.txt is used. The ending -pre is used for details printed at the beginning of the module, -post includes details shown at the end of the module.</description></item><item><title>Hello World from EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 12:35:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</guid><description>Here is the EMBA team with a brand new blog around EMBA and EMBArk the firmware scanning environment.
In the near future you will find some blog posts on things we are working on and firmware security scanning in general. For now enjoy the EMBA video.
