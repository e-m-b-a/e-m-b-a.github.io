We are very proud of this release and we want to highlight some details in the form of &amp;ldquo;How it started&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;How is it going&amp;rdquo;.
Included modules In August 2020 we started with 26 EMBA modules. Today EMBA has around 60 public modules.
Lines of Code In August 2020 EMBA was already quite big with ~3400 lines of code.</description></item><item><title>Join us at Black Hat Asia</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/emba_black_hat_asia_arsenal_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 12:38:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/emba_black_hat_asia_arsenal_2022/</guid><description>You can attend the Black Hat Business Hall for free - check it out and join our talk on firmware analysis with EMBA here.</description></item><item><title>EMBA v0.9.0 - Munich Edt released</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/munich-edt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 12:55:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/munich-edt/</guid><description>After around 1 and a half year of continuous development (and 1500 commits) we have decided to create our first official EMBA release.

While we started investigating the device via the network, we also wanted to use our firmware scanner EMBA for the automated firmware analysis tasks. The firmware was available from the QNAP download site and starting EMBA with the default profile looks like a quick win. After a while we realised that EMBA was running into the deep-extraction mode and finally failed extracting the needed firmware.</description></item><item><title>Reporting improvements for EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:04:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</guid><description>We have included a template mechanism for creating better and more customised reports in EMBA. Now it is possible to place plain text template files or shell scripts to the EMBA directory ./report_templates. The naming of the files is quite strict. This means for the module P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract.sh a reporting template with the name P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.sh or P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.txt is used. The ending -pre is used for details printed at the beginning of the module, -post includes details shown at the end of the module.</description></item><item><title>Hello World from EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 12:35:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</guid><description>Here is the EMBA team with a brand new blog around EMBA and EMBArk the firmware scanning environment.
In the near future you will find some blog posts on things we are working on and firmware security scanning in general. For now enjoy the EMBA video.
