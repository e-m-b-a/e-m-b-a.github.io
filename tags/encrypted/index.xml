While we started investigating the device via the network, we also wanted to use our firmware scanner EMBA for the automated firmware analysis tasks. The firmware was available from the QNAP download site and starting EMBA with the default profile looks like a quick win. After a while we realised that EMBA was running into the deep-extraction mode and finally failed extracting the needed firmware.</description></item></channel></rss>
