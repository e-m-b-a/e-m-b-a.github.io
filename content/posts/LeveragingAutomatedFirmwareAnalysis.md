The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem as well as critical infrastructure represents a rapidly growing technology field that connects billions of devices worldwide. The operating system of these devices is usually called firmware which is the foundational software that controls their functionality. The firmware could be some kind of real-time operating system, it could be Linux based or in very rare cases also a Windows operating system. Ensuring the security and integrity of firmware is crucial to prevent malicious attacks and unauthorized access. Automated firmware analysis is a crucial technique in enhancing the security of these devices, with tools like EMBA (Embedded Analyzer) providing a flexible and powerful open-source solution for firmware security scanning.
