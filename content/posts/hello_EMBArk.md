*****
Everything started as an idea in the beginning of 2021. The idea was to build an enterprise ready open source firmware analysis environment on top of _EMBA_. This environment should allow every product security team as well as every penetration tester and security researcher to use professional firmware analysis to improve the security of IoT/OT/ICS ... (you name it) devices as easy as possible. This idea was mixed up to an AMOS research project, where a team of students built a first PoC of _EMBArk_. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2021ss01-emba-service). From there on continuous work, improvement and testing was running more or less under the radar. 
And today ... _EMBArk_ is stable and ready for more!

*****
EMBArk is built for a team, it supports multiple user uploading and analyzing firmware simultaneously.

**Your hardware is the limit!**

Tracking a devices security over time - through different firmware versions - has never been this easy.
EMBArk centralizes all EMBA-reports in one place and let's you do great things with the results.

Easy to setup and even easier to use.
Putting [EMBA](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba)s capabilities in the hands of everyone.
