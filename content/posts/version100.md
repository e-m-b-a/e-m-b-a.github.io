In August 2020 we released EMBA to the world. 21 months or 1600 commits later version 1.0 is available. 

We are very proud of this release and we want to highlight some details in the form of "How it started" vs. "How is it going".

## Included modules
In August 2020 we started with 26 EMBA modules. Today EMBA has around 60 public modules.

## Software components, vulnerabilities and exploits
We know that you all love the automated detection of vulnerabilities and exploits from EMBA. This feature was not part of EMBA in August 2020, it was introduced between 12/2020 and 01/2021.
