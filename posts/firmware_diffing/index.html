For example, in exploit development you are sometimes interested in the changes between two firmware versions - The vulnerable version compared to the fixed version. As it is usually quite hard to extract enough useful information from the published advisories or the CVE details, the only possibility is to check the real differences between the relevant firmware releases. This allows a tear down of the fixed vulnerability and probably write an exploit for it.</p><p><em>EMBA</em> can support you in your tear down process as it is able to identify the differences between different firmware versions using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_hashing>fuzzy hashing</a> with <a href=https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html>ssdeep</a>.</p><p>For this diff mechanisms we introduced the <code>-o</code> option. This allows the setup of a 2nd firmware.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/8e09ec21-e972-43a6-b656-89c9bb113516 alt=image></p><p>The 2nd firmware is usually the newer firmware version (the fixed one). Start <em>EMBA</em> with the following options to perform the firmware diffing procedure:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>sudo ./emba -f ~/DIR600B1_2_FW205b01.zip -o ~/DIR600B_FW206b01_FOR_Hardware_B.bin -l ~/emba_logs_dir600-diff
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>EMBA</em> does not perform a usual firmware analysis in this mode!</p><h2 id=overview-of-both-firmware-images>Overview of both firmware images</h2><p>In diff mode <em>EMBA</em> first gives some details of both firmware images. This is similar to the already known <a href=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/blob/master/modules/P02_firmware_bin_file_check.sh>P02 module</a> but for both firmware images.</p><h3 id=1st-firmware-overview>1st firmware overview:</h3><p>In the following screenshot some details of the firmware images are shown. Currently, the available details are the output of the file command, entropy analysis, checksum and a the output of the first few bytes as hexdump:</p><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/d682807f-29b9-49d9-b603-8221368e00a9 alt=image></p><h3 id=2nd-firmware-overview>2nd firmware overview:</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/d494f566-ebc5-4673-bf0a-0591838121fd alt=image></p><h2 id=extraction-of-both-firmware-images>Extraction of both firmware images</h2><p>For further analysis it is needed to extract both firmware images before comparing them. As usual we are using Unblob as our main extractor:</p><h3 id=1st-firmware-extraction>1st firmware extraction:</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/5f9ae6fe-591c-4583-bd20-cbaa0ddf6987 alt=image></p><h3 id=2nd-firmware-extraction>2nd firmware extraction:</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/d4fbebc3-73a3-4153-bcea-543a1b7851f1 alt=image></p><h2 id=fuzz-diffing-firmware>Fuzz diffing firmware</h2><p>Finally <em>EMBA</em> tries to find every file from the first directory/firmware als in the second extracted firmware directory. If the file is available we automatically check if it is a binary or something clear text.</p><h3 id=overview-page>Overview page:</h3><p>The overview page is the main page of the firmware diffing results. It shows if a file is modified, if it is something kind of ascii or binary and finally it links to further results:</p><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/3e6cd757-8231-4bbf-a9b9-1095cae3a670 alt=image></p><h3 id=ascii-diffing-details>ASCII diffing details:</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/81fbbdc6-9b5b-4b67-b2e2-f642a6ab81be alt=image></p><h3 id=binary-diffing-details>Binary diffing details:</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/4e308b32-6fe4-4c2a-bfa1-8c3f07c9ae09 alt=image></p><p><img src=https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/assets/497520/098f6fbc-0909-4f78-8aad-2accfccdf811 alt=image></p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/emba>EMBA</a></li><li><a href=/tags/diffing>Diffing</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/e-m-b-a title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>&nbsp;<a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/securefirmware/ title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a>&nbsp;<div class=tooltip><a class=soc><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-info"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12" y2="8"/></svg></a><span class=tooltiptext>Build with Hugo & based on Archie Theme</span></div></footer><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-8PK23K2LEL"></script><script>var doNotTrack=!1;if(!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-8PK23K2LEL",{anonymize_ip:!1})}</script><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
