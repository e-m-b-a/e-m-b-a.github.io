Welcome to another huge EMBA release with a lot new features: EMBA v1.4.0 - ICS testing Editition
This time we have collected the following highlights for you:
less bugs -&amp;gt; more code -&amp;gt; more bugs? -&amp;gt; report all our bugs here Extended binary analysis via semgrep (see module s16) New static perl analysis via zarn (see module s27) Toolchain identification (see wiki) Improved update checking (see wiki) New scan interface (with integrated status bar) automatically enabled in most scan-profiles Improved multiple backend workflows Massive speedup of multiple EMBA modules (see https://github.</description></item><item><title>Hello EMBArk</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_embark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 08:48:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_embark/</guid><description>Everything started as an idea in the beginning of 2021. The idea was to build an enterprise ready open source firmware analysis environment on top of EMBA. This environment should allow every product security team as well as every penetration tester and security researcher to use professional firmware analysis to improve the security of IoT/OT/ICS &amp;hellip; (you name it) devices as easy as possible. This idea was mixed up to an AMOS research project, where a team of students built a first PoC of EMBArk.</description></item><item><title>Firmware diffing</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/firmware_diffing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 10:01:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/firmware_diffing/</guid><description>The identification of the relevant changes between firmware releases is an essential step in bug hunting. For example, in exploit development you are sometimes interested in the changes between two firmware versions - The vulnerable version compared to the fixed version. As it is usually quite hard to extract enough useful information from the published advisories or the CVE details, the only possibility is to check the real differences between the relevant firmware releases.</description></item><item><title>EMBA version 1.3.1 is out now</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/version_131/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 09:53:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/version_131/</guid><description>What happened since the last EMBA release?
There was the absolute great #Hackersummercamp with our talks at BSidesLV, ICS Village (DEF CON) and Black Hat (Arsenal). The recording of the BSides talk is already available here. Beside this, Nate did a really great talk at BruCON – see here.
Beside a lot of code cleanup, bug fixing and some little improvements the new firmware diffing mode is one of the highlights in version 1.</description></item><item><title>AI supported firmware analysis</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/ai_powered_firmware_analysis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 09:50:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/ai_powered_firmware_analysis/</guid><description>EMBA - The AI powered firmware security analyzer Why not use AI for firmware analysis? This is the idea we had since the public release of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3 and GPT-4 earlier this year.
We started testing OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT for different possible usage scenarios like the integration of further CVE explanation:
Additionally, we thought about a quick lookup for potential exploit code or POC’s:
It can be seen that the available information is quite limited because of the limited dataset for these types of requests.</description></item><item><title>EMBA version 1.1.2 is out now</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/version_112_knightrider/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 13:37:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/version_112_knightrider/</guid><description>Bonnie: I have a new feature integrated into K.I.T.T. Michael: Give me more details K.I.T.T.: With my new friend EMBA I am able to find the weak spot in every firmware.
40 years later &amp;hellip; K.I.T.T. is definitive able to analyze firmware with EMBA
Beside bug fixes this release introduces many new features. Since version 1.1.1 we introduced several new features and multiple improved areas:

Just to give you a feeling of how massive this update is Initial release had around 3400 lines of code Version 1.0.0 had around 12000 lines of code And now, Version 1.1.0 has more than 20000 lines of code New system-mode emulation environment We have replaced the old system-mode emulation modules completely with a new and improved environment.</description></item><item><title>EMBA goes to Vegas baby</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/lasvegas_intro_2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 09:04:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/lasvegas_intro_2022/</guid><description>It’s official, in August Pascal and myself will present the firmware security analyzer EMBA at Black Hat and DEF CON in Las Vegas. We are super excited and happy to have the possibility to show you the best firmware scanner on the best stage!

We are very proud of this release and we want to highlight some details in the form of &amp;ldquo;How it started&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;How is it going&amp;rdquo;.
Included modules In August 2020 we started with 26 EMBA modules. Today EMBA has around 60 public modules.
Lines of Code In August 2020 EMBA was already quite big with ~3400 lines of code.</description></item><item><title>Join us at Black Hat Asia</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/emba_black_hat_asia_arsenal_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 12:38:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/emba_black_hat_asia_arsenal_2022/</guid><description>You can attend the Black Hat Business Hall for free - check it out and join our talk on firmware analysis with EMBA here.</description></item><item><title>EMBA v0.9.0 - Munich Edt released</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/munich-edt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 12:55:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/munich-edt/</guid><description>After around 1 and a half year of continuous development (and 1500 commits) we have decided to create our first official EMBA release.

While we started investigating the device via the network, we also wanted to use our firmware scanner EMBA for the automated firmware analysis tasks. The firmware was available from the QNAP download site and starting EMBA with the default profile looks like a quick win. After a while we realised that EMBA was running into the deep-extraction mode and finally failed extracting the needed firmware.</description></item><item><title>EMBArk - the enterprise ready firmware scanning environment</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/embark_intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 08:03:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/embark_intro/</guid><description>EMBA is a command line tool only, which is primarly designed for penetration testers. In contradiction to this, EMBArk is the enterprise ready front-end wich uses EMBA as scanning back end. EMBArk is a Django based web front end which allows the management of the firmware scanning environment on one central system. Via EMBArk it is possible for multiple users (e.g. a pentesting or dev team) to access the scanner and initiate scan tasks via the web browser.</description></item><item><title>Reporting improvements for EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:04:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/reporting_templates/</guid><description>We have included a template mechanism for creating better and more customised reports in EMBA. Now it is possible to place plain text template files or shell scripts to the EMBA directory ./report_templates. The naming of the files is quite strict. This means for the module P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract.sh a reporting template with the name P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.sh or P11_dlink_SHRS_enc_extract-post.txt is used. The ending -pre is used for details printed at the beginning of the module, -post includes details shown at the end of the module.</description></item><item><title>Hello World from EMBA</title><link>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 12:35:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.securefirmware.de/posts/hello_world/</guid><description>Here is the EMBA team with a brand new blog around EMBA and EMBArk the firmware scanning environment.
In the near future you will find some blog posts on things we are working on and firmware security scanning in general. For now enjoy the EMBA video.
