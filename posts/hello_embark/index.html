The idea was to build an enterprise ready open source firmware analysis environment on top of <em>EMBA</em>. This environment should allow every product security team as well as every penetration tester and security researcher to use professional firmware analysis to improve the security of IoT/OT/ICS &mldr; (you name it) devices as easy as possible. This idea was mixed up to an AMOS research project, where a team of students built a first PoC of <em>EMBArk</em>. You can find the original project <a href=https://github.com/amosproj/amos2021ss01-emba-service>here</a>. From there on continuous work, improvement and testing was running more or less under the radar.
And today &mldr; <em>EMBArk</em> is stable and ready for more!</p><hr><p>EMBArk is built for a team, it supports multiple user uploading and analyzing firmware simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Your hardware is the limit!</strong></p><p>Tracking a devices security over time - through different firmware versions - has never been this easy.
EMBArk centralizes all EMBA-reports in one place and let&rsquo;s you do great things with the results.</p><p>Easy to setup and even easier to use.
